## Getting started

You can implement the input component by importing the `InputComponent` into the NgModule or standalone component of you angular app.

```html
import { InputComponent } from "@makino-software/design-system/input";
```

The input can be used in template-driven or reactive forms. The input has no required attribute. The default values are automatically set and can be seen in the _Component API_ section in the _Default_ table column.
You can and should configure the label and placeholder property by specifying a string.

To see how to integrate the input component click on _Show code_ in the fist canvas at the top of the page.

## Usage guidelines

It is a good idea to provide semantic labels and placeholders, that give the user an idea of the value that should be inserted into the input. Try to be more specific than `Name` for label or `Enter value` for placeholder,
e.g. try using `First name` or `Enter first name`.
